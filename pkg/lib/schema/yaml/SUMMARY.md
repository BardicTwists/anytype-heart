# YAML Package Restructuring Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Version Support (version.go)
- Created version constants (v1 legacy, v2 current)
- Implemented version detection from YAML data
- Added version compatibility checking
- Created migration functions between versions
- Added comprehensive version-specific tests

### 2. Version-Specific Parsing Tests (version_test.go)
- Tests for version info retrieval
- Version detection tests
- Compatibility checking tests
- Data migration tests
- Version-specific parsing behavior tests

### 3. Migration Guide (docs/YAMLSchemaMigration.md)
- Complete guide for migrating from old structure
- API reference for all functions
- Feature comparison table
- Code examples for common operations
- Troubleshooting section

### 4. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added schema architecture section
- Included YAML processing examples
- Updated directory structure
- Added important file references

### 5. Integration Test (integration_workflow_test.go)
- Complete workflow demonstration
- Schema creation and usage
- Legacy YAML parsing
- Version 2 export
- Version migration
- Schema export round-trip
- Edge case handling
- Complete markdown workflow

## Key Features Implemented

### Version System
- **v1 (Legacy)**: Basic YAML parsing without schema integration
- **v2 (Current)**: Full schema integration with property resolution
- Version headers in YAML (_schema_version)
- Automatic version detection
- Bi-directional migration support

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing code continues to work without changes
- Version detection defaults to legacy for unmarked files
- Migration tools for upgrading/downgrading
- Property name mapping during migration

### Integration Points
- PropertyResolver interface for schema integration
- File path resolution for relative paths
- Option value resolution for status/tag fields
- Custom property name mapping for export

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: YAML handling is now isolated in its own package
2. **Version Management**: Clear versioning strategy for future changes
3. **Schema Integration**: Direct integration with the schema system
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new versions and features
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including integration tests

## Usage Examples

### Basic Parsing
```go
frontMatter, content, err := yaml.ExtractYAMLFrontMatter(markdownBytes)
result, err := yaml.ParseYAMLFrontMatter(frontMatter)
```

### With Schema Integration
```go
result, err := yaml.ParseYAMLFrontMatterWithResolver(frontMatter, schemaResolver)
```

### Export with Options
```go
yamlContent, err := yaml.ExportSchemaToYAML(schema, &yaml.ExportOptions{
    IncludeObjectType: true,
    PropertyNameMap: customNames,
})
```

### Version Migration
```go
newData, err := yaml.MigrateData(oldData, yaml.VersionLegacy, yaml.VersionCurrent, options)
```

The YAML package is now fully restructured with complete backward compatibility and comprehensive documentation.
